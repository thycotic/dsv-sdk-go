Over the past year, two privileged access management leaders—Centrify and Thycotic— combined to bring to market a comprehensive platform uniquely built to enable, empower, and secure the modern, hybrid enterprise.
All Thycotic integrations have now been rebranded and will be developed and maintained on the new Delinea GitHub. You can find the latest version of this repo [here](https://github.com/DelineaXPM/dsv-sdk-go).
